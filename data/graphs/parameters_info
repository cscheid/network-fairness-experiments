Two communities were created using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) benchmark following two different scenarios - see below. The settings for each model were chosen to create communities as similar as possible, while retaining the desired difference in degree distribution - characteristic of the LFR. 
(i) Isolated communities
- SBM: intra= 0.01 / inter = 0.0001, such that the average degree is app. 10 and max degree is between 20 and 25
- LFR: averageDegree = 10 / maxDegree = 40 / mixingParameter = 0.015
(ii) More connected communities:
- SBM: intra= 0.019 / inter = 0.001, such that the average degree is 20 and the max degree is around 34 to 38
- LFR: averageDegree = 20 / maxDegree = 50 / mixingParameter = 0.05
Communities were created 10 times for each of these 4 experiments. The node list, edge list, and degree distribution for each iteration can be found in the folder. These are used to run all subsequent experiments. 

Two communities were created using the SBM, where the first community (‘essential worker’ community) has a higher degree distribution - implemented by a higher intra and inter probabilities - than the second community.
(i) Isolated communities
- Regular (non-essential worker): intra= 0.01 / inter = 0.0001
- High degree (essential worker): intra= 0.015 / inter = ​​0.00015
