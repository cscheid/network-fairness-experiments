Two Erdos-Renyi graphs $n=1000$ - each containing two mutually-exclusive populations connected to and with each other according to varying degrees of (i) homophily, (ii) preferential attachment, (iii) diversity - connected to one another by random edges, $p=0.0001$.
FIRST: we just vary the proportions
We vary the parameters of the two populations, as well as the proportions of each population, and look at the access probabilities.
RUN once for HomophilyBA AND once for Diversified Homophily BA. 

```{python}
from exps import *
from generate_demographics_graph import *
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
import random

params = dict(
    # graph params
    model = "basic",
    n = 100,
    p1 = 0.01 / 2,
    p2 = 0.01 / 2,
    M = 0.2, 
    E = 2, 
    N = 100,
    H = 0.5,
    ALPHA = 1,
    PD = 0.6, 
    ED = 1,
    p_inter = 0.0001,
    # seeding params
    seed1 = 0.3,
    seed2 = 0.3,
    # IC params
    alpha = 0.1,
    reprs = 10000,
    communities = [list(range(0, 100)), list(range(100, 200))]) 

```

We generate a community graph and seeds:

```{python}
params["graph"] = demographics_communities(params)
params["seeds"] = set_seeds(params)
```

Then, we run the IC computation:

```{python}
ic_result = run_experiment(params)
ic_result = f(ic_result, params)
c1, c2, ma, mi = split_result_by_demographics(ic_result, params)
```

Finally, we plot the distribution of access probabilities across the
communities for each demographic group:

# Basic

Access probs:
```{python}
#| echo: false
plt.figure()
plot_demographics_dists(ic_result, params)
plt.show()
```
