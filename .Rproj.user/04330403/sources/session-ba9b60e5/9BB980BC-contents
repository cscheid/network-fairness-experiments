Two Erdos-Renyi graphs $n=1000, p=0.01$ connected to one another with random edges, $p=0.0001$.
We overseed one community and look at the access probabilities.

(I'm dividing the probability by 2 there so that my results match
those of the students. I'm pretty sure this is harmless and coming
from different convention on how to interpret the values in symmetric
graphs when generating them, etc.)

```{python}
#| code-fold: show
from exps import *

overseeding_factor = 4

params = dict(
    # graph params
    n = 1000,
    p1 = 0.01 / 2,
    p2 = 0.01 / 2,
    p_inter = 0.0001 / 2,
    # seeding params
    seed1 = overseeding_factor * 0.1,
    seed2 = 0.1,
    # IC params
    alpha = 0.1,
    reprs = 10000,
    communities = [list(range(0, 1000)), list(range(1000, 2000))]
    )
    
```

We generate a community graph and seeds:

```{python}
params["graph"] = two_communities(params)
params["seeds"] = set_seeds(params)
```

Then, we run the IC computation:

```{python}
ic_result = run_experiment(params)
```

Finally, we plot the distribution of access probabilities across the
communities:

# Basic

Access probs:
```{python}
#| echo: false
plt.figure()
plot_community_dists(ic_result, params)
plt.show()
```

$x^2$ access probs:

Access probs:
```{python}
#| echo: false
plt.figure()
plot_community_dists(list(v ** 2 for v in ic_result), params)
plt.show()
```
